
## Part 4: Anomaly Detection


METRIC OF SUCCCESS
Being able to show any anomalies in the total sales throughout the months , this will help 
in fraud detection in the supermarket




Loading the data

```{r}
head(forecast)

```
```R
# Installing anomalize package
# ---
# 
install.packages("anomalize")
install.packages("tidyverse")
```


```R
# Load tidyverse and anomalize
# ---
# 
library(tidyverse)
library(anomalize)

```

```{r}
# Collect our time series data
# ---
# 
tidyverse_cran_downloads
```

```
## Detecting our anomalies

```{r}
tidyverse_cran_downloads %>%
    time_decompose(count) %>%
    anomalize(remainder) %>%
    time_recompose() %>%
    plot_anomalies(time_recomposed = TRUE, ncol = 4, alpha_dots = 0.5)
```
The plots below basically shows the total sales throughout the months from 2017 to 2018 
then our algorithm showed us the anomalies in sales which is visaulized by the red marks on the plots
